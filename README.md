# Become a Software Professional 2023

## Week 01: 
### Prototyping in Figma
````

For this week's project, we were divided into groups to create a prototype for a gym management system. Each group was responsible for a specific section of the system, including Landing Page, Sign Up/Log In, SuperAdmin, Admin, Trainer, and Member/User. We used Figma to design the prototype and collaborated to ensure a cohesive user experience.

## Week 02: 
### Git Implementation and GitHub Repository: BaSP-M2023
````

I implemented Git for version control and created a GitHub repository called BaSP-M2023 to store and manage the project's files, which allow me to easily track changes.

### Building the website using HTML

````

During this week, I focused on developing the HTML structure of the Landing Page. This involved working with the wireframe and prototype developed during the previous week on Figma to create the necessary HTML elements and content for the page.

I started by breaking down the different sections of the page into individual HTML elements, including the header, nav, main content, and footer. Within each section, I carefully crafted the appropriate HTML tags to create a well-organized and semantically meaningful structure for the page, for accessibility and SEO purposes.
