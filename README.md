# Become a Software Professional 2023

## Week 01: 
### Prototyping in Figma

For this week's project, we were divided into groups to create a prototype for a gym management system. Each group was responsible for a specific section of the system, including Landing Page, Sign Up/Log In, SuperAdmin, Admin, Trainer, and Member/User. We used Figma to design the prototype and collaborated to ensure a cohesive user experience.

I implemented Git for version control and created a GitHub repository called BaSP-M2023 to store and manage the project's files, which allow me to easily track changes.

### Building the website using HTML

During this week, I focused on developing the HTML structure of the Landing Page. This involved working with the wireframe and prototype developed during the previous week on Figma to create the necessary HTML elements and content for the page.

I started by breaking down the different sections of the page into individual HTML elements, including the header, nav, main content, and footer. Within each section, I carefully crafted the appropriate HTML tags to create a well-organized and semantically meaningful structure for the page, for accessibility and SEO purposes.


## Week 03:
### Styling the website using CSS pixel-perfect method

During this week, I focused on implementing the CSS for the Landing Page of the gym management system. I used the pixel-perfect method to ensure that the design was faithfully recreated in code.
To achieve the pixel-perfect look, I did not use modern layout techniques such as flexbox or grid. Instead, I relied on traditional CSS layout methods such as float, inline-block, and positioning. This allowed me to accurately place and style each element of the page according to the design specifications.


## Week 04:
### Styling the website using CSS Responsive design with Flexblox

During this week, I applied responsive design principles to the same Landing Page using flexbox. I followed the mobile-first approach, designing for smaller screen sizes first and gradually scaling up, using media-queries. I used flexbox to create a flexible and adaptable layout that could adjust to different screen sizes while maintaining its structure and readability.

To display the sidebar on the mobile version, you need to change: 

```
display: none;
```
to:
```
display: flex;
``` 
on __line 2__ of the __aside.css__ file.

## Week 05:
### JavaScript Exercises using ES5

[JavaScript Exercises Week-05 GitHub Pages](https://maurocaffesse.github.io/BaSP-M2023/Week-05/)

During this week, I completed several JavaScript exercises using ECMAScript 5. These exercises covered topics such as variables and operators, strings, arrays, conditionals, loops, and functions. I applied my knowledge of these concepts to solve various problems and challenges, improving my problem-solving skills and familiarity with JavaScript syntax.
